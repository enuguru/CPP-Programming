Question 1.
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice

You can return the answer in any order

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


question 2

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. Convert roman numerals into decimal

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

Example:
1.Input: "III"
Output: 3
2.Input: "IV"
Output: 4


Question 3:Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1]

Example:Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]


Question 4:Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

Assume no duplicates in the array.

Example
1.Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
2.Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4	


Question 5:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory


Output:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
1. pass a function as a variable to another function
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length

Question 6:
Pass a function as a parameter to another function

Question 7:
2. can you declare a function with in one function in C++ ?
