why do we use #include <iostream> at the top of C++ files ?

iostream is the predefined library function used for input and output, called as header files.

iostream is the header file which contains all the functions of program like cout, cin etc. and #include tells the preprocessor to include these header file in the program.

include <iostream.h>
#include is known as a preprocessor directive,which is used to load filesâ€¦

<> indicate the start and end of file name to be loaded.. you can use " " quotes too instead of <>
<> are for header files(files with extension .h)
"" for c files (files with extension .c)
