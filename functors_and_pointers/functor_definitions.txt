definitions of functors

unlike a function pointer a functor can hold state

functors are functions with a state

The functor is just a class where the function call operator is overloaded

It is faster than using a function pointer

because functors can hold state it can be customizable, you customize 
it when you create an object of the class

the function inside the functor class can be overloaded

because functors are objects of a class they can be conveniently 
passed to templates, other functions etc

since they can be passed on to other functions and hold state 
information functors are like closures
