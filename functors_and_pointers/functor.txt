Functors are functions with a state. 

In C++ you can realize them as a class with one or more private members to store the 
state and with an overloaded operator () to execute the function. 

Functors can encapsulate C and C++ function pointers employing the concepts templates and 
polymorphism. You can build up a list of pointers to member functions of arbitrary classes 
and call them all through the same interface without bothering about their class or the 
need of a pointer to an instance. 

All the functions just have got to have the same return-type and calling parameters. Sometimes 
functors are also known as closures. 

You can also use functors to implement callbacks.
