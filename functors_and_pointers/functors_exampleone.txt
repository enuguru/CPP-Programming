example of function object

This creates a functor class with a constructor that takes an integer argument and saves it. 
When objects of the class are "called", it will return the result of adding the saved value 
and the argument to the functor:

 
class myFunctorClass
{
    public:
        myFunctorClass (int x) : _x( x ) {}
        int operator() (int y) { return _x + y; }
    private:
        int _x;
};

 
int main()
{
    myFunctorClass addFive( 5 );
    std::cout << addFive( 6 );
 
    return 0;
}

In short, the act of constructing an object lets you give the functor information that it can 
use inside the implementation of its function-like behavior (when the functor is called through operator()).
