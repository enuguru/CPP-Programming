You can use three techniques in conversion from one data type to another.

1. Conversion functions or typecast operator in the source class

2. One argument constructor in the destination class

3. Assignment operator in the destination class


there are four conversion types possible

1. Built in type to user defined type class type

2. user defined class type to Built in type

3. user defined type to user defined type

4. Built in type to Built in type

for c to c (user defined to user deined or class to class) we can use any of the above three techniques

for user defined to built in we can only use typecast operator or conversion function in the
source class. this is because we cannot touch the destionation class because they are built in
(that code is in the compiler)

for built in to user defined again we can use two of the three techniuqes possible given above
this is because typecast operator can be only in source class but the source class here is the
built in type whose code we cannot touch (it is in the compiler)

the conversion from built in to built in can be done with the help of static_cast, dynamic_cast,
const_cast, reinterpret_cast.
